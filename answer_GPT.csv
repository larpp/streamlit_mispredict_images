data/ImageNet/val/999/ILSVRC2012_val_00042643.JPEG,toilet_tissue,999,paper_towel,700,"The misclassification likely occurred due to the visual similarity between toilet tissue and paper towel rolls, such as shape, color, and texture, which can confuse the model."
data/ImageNet/val/999/ILSVRC2012_val_00046353.JPEG,toilet_tissue,999,altar,406,"The misclassification likely occurred due to visual similarities in shapes or context within the image, such as the arrangement of objects, lighting, or background, resembling features of an altar."
data/ImageNet/val/999/ILSVRC2012_val_00047144.JPEG,toilet_tissue,999,hamster,333,"The model misclassified the image due to the presence of a hamster partially surrounded by toilet tissue, causing confusion between the objects."
data/ImageNet/val/999/ILSVRC2012_val_00049174.JPEG,toilet_tissue,999,paper_towel,700,"The misclassification could be due to the similar texture and color between toilet tissue and paper towels, making it difficult for the model to differentiate. Additionally, the model might not have enough training data for accurate differentiation."
